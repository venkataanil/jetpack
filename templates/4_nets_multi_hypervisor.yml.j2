# The following structure used for multi hypervisor deployments,
# where undercloud, Controllers and Computes are virtual but created
# on mutiple hypervisors. 3 networks are bridged outside of the local
# hypervisor hosts, but not having external connectivity. VMs will have
# external connectivity through management network (using NAT on
# local hypervisor).
# the hybrid deployments,
# * br-ctlplane - used for provisioning
# * management - external connectivity
# * br-vlan - used for OSPd internal services (internal/tenent api)
# * external - tenants external connectivity
